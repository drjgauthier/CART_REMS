|:----:|     :----:    |  :----:         |
|Grade 1| If onset 72 hours or more after infusion, treat symptomatically. If onset less than 72 hours after infusion, consider tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV over 1 hour (not to exceed 800 mg).| Consider dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 24 hours.|
|Grade 2|Administer tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV over 1 hour (not to exceed 800 mg). Repeat tocilizumab every 8 hours as needed if not responsive to intravenous fluids or increasing supplemental oxygen. Limit to a maximum of 3 doses in a 24-hour period; maximum total of 4 doses.|Consider dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 to 24 hours.
  
If no improvement within 24 hours or rapid progression, repeat tocilizumab and escalate dose and frequency of dexamethasone (20 mg IV every 6 to 12 hours). If no improvement within 24 hours or continued rapid progression, switch to methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg divided 4 times per day. After 2 doses of tocilizumab, consider alternative anti-cytokine agents. Do not exceed 3 doses of tocilizumab in 24 hours, or 4 doses in total.
